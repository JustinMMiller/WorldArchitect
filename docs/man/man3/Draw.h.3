\fBdrawPointsVector(Vector v, BMP *bmp)\fP
.PP
This function takes in a Vector (a Vector consists of an origin point and a direction vector (also a Point because math)) and renders it onto the given BMP\&. This function currently does nothing\&. may be used later\&. Was from original tests with qdbmp library\&.
